# AWS Secure Static Website Hosting üöÄ

This project demonstrates hosting a secure static website on AWS using:

Amazon S3 (Private) + CloudFront (OAI) + WAF + CloudWatch Logs + SNS + CloudWatch Alarm + Cost Explorer & Budgets

The website is fully private, served securely through CloudFront protected with AWS WAF, monitored via CloudWatch and cost-managed with Budgets and Cost Explorer.
## üìã Detailed Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Create a Private S3 Bucket
1.	Navigate to AWS Console ‚Üí S3 ‚Üí Create bucket
2.	Bucket name: awsfirst-project
3.	Block Public Access: Enable all options ‚úÖ
4.	Create bucket
5.  Upload Website Files:
‚Ä¢	Upload index.html, CSS, JS, images
‚Ä¢	Files remain private (no public access)
### Step 2: Create CloudFront Distribution with OAI
1.	Go to CloudFront ‚Üí Create distribution
2.	Origin domain: Choose your S3 bucket
3.	Origin access:
‚Ä¢	Select Origin Access Identity (OAI)
‚Ä¢	Create new OAI ‚Üí
         Update bucket policy automatically ‚úÖ
5.	Viewer protocol policy:
         Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
7.	Default root object: index.html
8.	Create distribution and wait until Deployed

### Test:
‚Ä¢	Visit your CloudFront domain 
  ```url
   (e.g., https://dXXXX.cloudfront.net)
  ```
‚Ä¢	You should see your index.html

### Step 3: Attach AWS WAF to CloudFront
1.	Go to WAF & Shield ‚Üí Web ACLs ‚Üí Create web ACL
2.	Region: Global (CloudFront)
3.	Resources to protect: Select your CloudFront distribution
4.	Add AWS Managed Rules:
          ‚Ä¢	AWSManagedRulesCommonRuleSet (common attacks)
          ‚Ä¢	AWSManagedRulesKnownBadInputsRuleSet (SQL Injection, XSS)
5.	Create Web ACL
‚úÖ Your website is now protected from SQL Injection and XSS attacks.

### Step 4: Enable CloudWatch Logs for WAF
1.	Navigate to WAF ‚Üí Your Web ACL ‚Üí Logging and metrics tab
2.	Click Enable logging ‚Üí CloudWatch Logs
3.	Create log group: aws-waf-logs-webacl-first
4.	Enable Store full logs ‚úÖ

Sample Log JSON:
{
  "action": "BLOCK",
  "httpSourceIp": "103.15.120.50",
  "httpUri": "/admin.php",
  "country": "BD",
  "terminatingRuleId": "AWS-AWSManagedRulesCommonRuleSet"
}

### Step 5: Set Up Amazon SNS for Notifications (Independent)
1.	Go to Amazon SNS ‚Üí Create topic
            ‚Ä¢	Type: Standard
            ‚Ä¢	Name: WAFNotifications
2.	Create subscription ‚Üí
             Protocol:  Email ‚Üí Add your email
4.	Check your inbox and Confirm subscription
5.	You can now manually publish notifications or link with alarms later if needed

‚úÖ SNS is now ready to send notifications separately.

### Step 6: Create a CloudWatch Alarm for WAF Activity
1.	Go to CloudWatch ‚Üí Alarms ‚Üí Create alarm
2.	Select metric:
      ‚Ä¢	WAFV2 ‚Üí WebACL ‚Üí BlockedRequests
3.	Threshold example:
      ‚Ä¢	Trigger if >= 60 requests within 1 minutes
4.	Alarm action:
      ‚Ä¢ Send notification to your existing SNS topic (WAFNotifications)
5.	Alarm name: ```WAF-BlockedRequests-High``` ‚Üí Create alarm

‚úÖ You will receive email alerts whenever the blocked requests exceed the threshold.

### Step 7: Enable Cost Explorer and AWS Budgets
1.	Billing ‚Üí Cost Explorer ‚Üí Enable Cost Explorer
2.	Budgets ‚Üí Create budget ‚Üí Cost budget
   ‚Ä¢	Example: $5 per month
o	Add your email for budget alerts
3.	Monitor usage and spending in Cost Explorer dashboard
‚úÖ You will receive alerts if AWS spending exceeds your defined budget.

### Project Output
‚Ä¢	Secure Static Website URL via CloudFront (HTTPS)
‚Ä¢	WAF Protection with blocked requests (403 Forbidden)
‚Ä¢	CloudWatch Logs with request details
‚Ä¢	SNS Notifications for alerts
‚Ä¢	CloudWatch Alarm for blocked traffic spikes
‚Ä¢	Cost Management with AWS Budgets and Cost Explorer

### Problem Statement ‚ö†Ô∏è

During the implementation of this AWS Secure Static Website Hosting project, two main challenges were encountered:

1Ô∏è‚É£**CloudFront did not serve the ``index.html`` file**

‚Ä¢	**Issue:** After creating the CloudFront distribution, the website URL showed Access Denied or a blank page instead of loading ``index.html``.
‚Ä¢	**Cause:** CloudFront requires a Default Root Object to be set ``(e.g., index.html)`` when serving content from a private S3 bucket via OAI.

**Solution:**
‚Ä¢	Updated the CloudFront Distribution ‚Üí Default Root Object to ``index.html``
‚Ä¢	After deployment, the website loaded successfully.

2Ô∏è‚É£**CloudWatch Logs did not capture WAF logs**
‚Ä¢	Issue: After enabling WAF logging, no logs appeared in CloudWatch initially.
‚Ä¢	Cause: WAF logging requires a specific log group naming format in CloudWatch for the connection to work properly.

**Solution:**
‚Ä¢	Created a CloudWatch log group with the format:
‚Ä¢	```aws-waf-logs-<name>```
**Example:** ```aws-waf-logs-securewebsite```
‚Ä¢	Re-attached the log group to the WAF Web ACL and enabled full logging.
‚Ä¢	Logs started appearing in CloudWatch Logs as expected.

**Key Takeaways**
‚Ä¢	Always configure the Default Root Object in CloudFront to serve static websites correctly.
‚Ä¢	Use the correct log group naming format (aws-waf-logs-<name>) for WAF to successfully push logs to CloudWatch.

**This Problem Statement will help others avoid the same configuration mistakes when deploying a secure AWS static website.**
