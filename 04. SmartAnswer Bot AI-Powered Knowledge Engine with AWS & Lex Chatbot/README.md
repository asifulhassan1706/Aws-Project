4. If the models are unavailable, click **Request Model Access**, select the models, and submit your request. Approval may take a few minutes.
5. Confirm the models are active before proceeding.

**Purpose:**
This step ensures the chatbot can access powerful AI models essential for processing and responding to user inputs. The Anthropic Claude model enables human-like conversations while managing costs. The Amazon Titan Embeddings model generates high-quality text embeddings for RAG, allowing efficient retrieval of relevant information from the S3 knowledge base.

**Notes:**

* Verify your AWS account has necessary permissions for Bedrock access.
* Confirm the models are available in your AWS region.


### ✅ Step 2: Create an Amazon S3 Bucket

Set up an Amazon S3 bucket to store documents that form the chatbot’s RAG knowledge base.

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to **Amazon S3**.
2. Click **Create Bucket** and enter a globally unique name (e.g., `asif-chatbot`).
3. Choose the same AWS region as your Amazon Bedrock setup to minimize latency.
4. Enable **Block All Public Access** to keep the bucket private and secure.
5. Complete the creation with default settings unless specific configurations are needed.
6. Upload sample documents (PDFs, text files, Word documents) to the bucket for use in RAG-based responses.

**Purpose:**
This step secures an S3 bucket to store the chatbot’s knowledge base documents, such as FAQs and manuals. Blocking public access ensures data privacy and security, which is critical for system reliability and compliance.

**Notes:**

* The bucket name must be unique and follow AWS naming conventions (lowercase, numbers, hyphens).
* Confirm supported document formats for Bedrock (PDF, TXT, CSV).
* IAM roles will be configured later to allow Bedrock access to the bucket.


### ✅ Step 3: Create a Knowledge Base in Amazon Bedrock

Set up a knowledge base in Amazon Bedrock integrated with your S3 bucket to enable the chatbot to retrieve information from uploaded documents for RAG.

1. Navigate to **Amazon Bedrock** in the AWS Management Console.
2. Select **Knowledge Bases** from the sidebar and click **Create Knowledge Base**.
3. Choose **Knowledge Base with Vector Store** to support unstructured text (e.g., PDFs) and semantic search. Avoid the structured data store since it requires manual preprocessing, which is unsuitable for PDFs.
4. Name the knowledge base (e.g., `knowledge-base-quick-start-dowsg`).
5. Use default IAM permissions and select **Create and use a new service role**.
6. Set **Data Source Type** to **Amazon S3**, since your PDFs are stored there, then click **Next**.
7. Select your S3 bucket from the same AWS account.
8. Keep other settings at default and click **Next**.
9. Choose **Amazon Titan Embeddings G1 – Text V1.2** as the embedding model.
10. Select **Quick create a new vector store (recommended)** with **Amazon OpenSearch Serverless** as the vector store type, then proceed.
11. Review your settings and create the knowledge base. Wait a few minutes for setup completion.
12. After creation, select the data source and click **Sync**.
13. Wait until the knowledge base status shows **Available**, indicating readiness.

**Purpose:**
This step creates a knowledge base that enables semantic search over your document corpus, allowing the chatbot to retrieve relevant information efficiently. The integration with vector store and embeddings supports fast, accurate responses from unstructured PDFs.

**Notes:**

* Ensure the S3 bucket and Bedrock are in the same AWS region to minimize latency.
* Verify the IAM role has necessary permissions for S3 and Bedrock access.
* Sync time varies based on document size and quantity.


### ✅ Step 4: Set Up an Amazon Lex Bot

Create and configure an Amazon Lex V2 bot to handle user conversations, define intents, and set up responses.

1. Navigate to **Amazon Lex V2** > **Bots** > **Create Bot**.
2. Select **Traditional** and create a blank bot.
3. Enter a bot name (e.g., `Question0-ANswer-Bot`).
4. Create or assign an IAM role with Amazon Lex permissions.
5. Select the appropriate **Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)** compliance setting and click **Next**.
6. Choose your preferred language, optionally add a description, select a voice, then finish setup.
7. Create an intent (e.g., `Welcome-Intent`).
8. Add sample utterances like “Hello,” “Hi,” or “Good Morning.”
9. Define the initial response, e.g., “Hi! How can I help you?”
10. Under **Advanced Options**, set **Next Step in Conversation** to **Wait for User Input**, then update.
11. Return to the intents dashboard. You will see the newly created intent and the default intent.
12. Build the bot configuration and wait for a successful build message.
